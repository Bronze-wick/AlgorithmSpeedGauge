# AlgorithmSpeedGauge
A demonstration written entirely for pleasure, to compare the speeds of my various computers.

As sorting algorithims perform their duties, the resouces provided to them from the hardware in conjunction with the style sorting, can have a profound affect on the time in which the sort runs. 

This program sets starting points and ending points, to measure the time of completion of various sorting algorithims. The unsorted list are randomized and autogenerated, in an attempt to maintain constant and unbiased results.
